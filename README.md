#Keyboard Layout Files
The [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files in this repository are intended to be used with [`JACKeyboard`](http://JaredCrawford.org/JACKeyboard/Documentation). It is my goal to allow developers (or even end users) to submit pull requests with their own keyboard definition files for inclusion in an app based on `JACKeyboard`.

#Contributions
Please feel free to create or modify any keyboard you would like to see. While I can't guarantee that your keyboard will make it in the app, I'm always interested in high-quality, thoughtful submissions. If you have any questions, just ask.

#Creating a Keyboard
Please be sure to read through [`JACKeyboard`'s documentation](http://JaredCrawford.org/JACKeyboard/Documentation) before you attempt to create a keyboard. After reading the documentation, I reccomend you copy the `English (QWERTY)` folder and use that keyboard as a base. Of course, different languages may require completely different layouts, so you may also wish to start from scratch.
